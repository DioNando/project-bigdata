Another instance happened just last month and left me laughing my ass off at the absurdity of it all. Was waiting in line to enter the football stadium, a black non-Moroccan was wearing a football jersey they weren't supposed to, a cop talked to his superior, saying "I don't want to sound racist but we need to tell him to remove the jersey", then without skipping a beat, screams "Mon ami! Mon ami! you need to remove the jersey", he didn't want to be racist lol

These are the same people who cry about racism towards Moroccans in Europe.

Racism is very broad as a concept. Moroccan can be friendly  to a french and be hostile to another. the only reason is the first is a total stranger, and the second came with a friend.... so we are more Xenophobic  than racist. 

Our jokes can be racist, but it's  more of an expression  of fear of the strangers.
